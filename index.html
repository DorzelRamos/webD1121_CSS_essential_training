    <h1>There's a diffence between HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <dd>HTML is used for content structure and semantic meaning</dd>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <dd>CSS is used for styling and changing apperances of the webpages elements</dd>
    <br>
    <p>The <b>devs tool</b> within a browser can be used to see your HTML and CSS code. This can be 
    applied to most websites including your own.</p>
    <h2>Referencing CSS</h2>
    <p>There's three different methods to do this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>External</li>
        <br>
        <li>Inline</li>
        <br>
        <li>Internal</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>External</h3>
    <p>A separate CSS file an be made and saved with a CSS extension. It can be loaded
        with either a <i>link tag</i> within the HTML or the <i>@import method</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Link Tag</h4>
    <!--The link tag is a void element so it doesn't need a closing tag-->
    <p>The link tag is always referenced within the head of the HTML using the two attributes
        <em>rel</em> and <em>href</em>. External CSS files can be linked to other HTML files.
    </p>
<h4>@import method</h4>
    <p>This method can import one or more stylesheets into the HTML or CSS. The downside to using 
        is that it could slow down your page. Commonly used with <i>SASS</i> and <i>LESS</i> processors.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline</h3>
    <p>Uses a style attribute which is added onto the an opening HTML tag. CSS style rules are added
        as a value. Use sparringly because it can overwrite any othe method. Applies to individual elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Internal</h3>
    <p>CSS is added between style tags in the head of the document. <i>CSS selectors</i> are added to
    stylize each element it matches. Best use for short blocks applied to one page.</p>

    <h3>Relative & Absolute paths</h3>
    <p><strong>REMEMBER NOT TO HOTLINK YOUR PATHS!</strong></p>
    <h4>Relative path</h4>
        <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. Use for referencing 
            resources <i>within your own project files</i>
        </p>
    <h4>Absolute path</h4>
        <p>An absolute file path is the full URL to a file. Use absolute paths for <i>outside sources</i></p>
